Phishing Email Analysis - Cyber Security Internship Task
Sender Email: microsoft@email-records.com
1. Spoofed Sender:
   - Appears to be Microsoft, but domain is suspicious (not @microsoft.com).

2. Suspicious Link:
- Visible link says "Confirm Account", but actual URL is http://microsoft-security-check.com (NOT Microsoft's domain).

3. Urgent Language:
   - "Failure to act within 24 hours" is a classic scare tactic.

4. Generic Greeting:
   - Starts with "Dear User" instead of my actual name.

5. Grammar & Style:
   - No spelling mistakes, but robotic tone which is common in phishing.

6. Missing Headers:
- Since this was a sample, I couldn't view real email headers. But a real header check would reveal SPF/DKIM failure or domain mismatch.

Conclusion:
This email has multiple phishing indicators and should NOT be trusted.
